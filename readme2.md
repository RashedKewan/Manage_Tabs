### Opening multiple tabs in ***Google Chrome*** can cause several things:

* Increased memory usage: Each tab in Google Chrome runs as a separate process, and as you open more tabs, the memory usage on your computer can increase.

* Slowed performance: With more tabs open, your computer may slow down and become less responsive, especially if you have limited memory and processing power.

* Reduced battery life: More tabs in Google Chrome can consume more battery power, especially on laptops and mobile devices.

* Confusing navigation: With too many tabs open, it can become difficult to find and switch between the tabs you need, leading to a cluttered and confusing browsing experience.
